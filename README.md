# AI Engineering Journey

A living documentation of my transition into AI Engineering, mapping existing capabilities, current learning, and future trajectory.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **Capability Map**: Clear view of my skillsets across UX/Strategy and AI Engineering
- **Learning Tracker**: Documentation of courses, projects, and experiments
- **Professional Context**: For conversations with collaborators, employers, and fellow practitioners

## Navigation

- **[Skillset Mapping](./SKILLSET_MAPPING.md)** - Comprehensive view of capabilities: what I have, what I'm learning, what's next
- **[Learning Notes](./learning-notes/)** - Key concepts, insights, and references from coursework
- **[Projects](./projects/)** - Hands-on implementations and experiments
- **[Resources](./resources/)** - Curated tools, articles, and references

## Current Focus

**Active Learning**: Bootcamp on Generative AI, LLM Apps, AI Agents
- Currently: Prompt Engineering fundamentals
- In Progress: RAG systems, LangChain/LangGraph
- Upcoming: Vector databases, fine-tuning, deployment

## Background Context

Coming from **15+ years in UX/Product Strategy**, I bring:
- Strong product thinking and usability perspective
- Strategic vision beyond technical execution
- Cross-functional collaboration and translation between business and technical domains
- Deep experience with design systems, user research, and interaction patterns

Addressing the gap in AI Engineering where technical execution often lacks product sense and usability focus.
