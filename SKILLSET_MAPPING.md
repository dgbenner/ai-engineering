## Unique Value Proposition

### Where UX/Strategy Background Creates Advantage

**Product Sense Over Pure Technical Execution**
- Can identify when teams fixate on speed/debugging without vision
- Understand that model performance means nothing without usability
- Bridge between "it works technically" and "it works for users"

**Human-Centered AI Development**
- Apply user research methods to model behavior testing
- Design conversation flows that feel natural, not robotic
- Consider accessibility, localization, edge cases from the start

**Strategic Thinking**
- Connect AI capabilities to business value
- Roadmap AI features within product strategy
- Understand when AI is (and isn't) the right solution

**Cross-Functional Translation**
- Communicate between data scientists, engineers, and business stakeholders
- Facilitate alignment around user needs vs technical possibilities
- Document and systematize patterns others miss

## Notes

This map is **intentionally dynamic**. AI Engineering as a discipline is still forming, and skillsets are evolving rapidly. The goal isn't to have everything locked down, but to:

1. Provide clarity on current capabilities
2. Show active learning and progression
3. Demonstrate strategic thinking about skill development
4. Make it easy for collaborators to see where I am and where I'm going

The absence of something from this map doesn't necessarily indicate a gap - it may simply be emerging, undefined, or not yet relevant to my particular path in AI Engineering.
