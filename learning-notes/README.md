# Learning Notes

Organized notes, concepts, and insights from courses, experiments, and research.

## Structure

### By Topic
- `prompt-engineering/` - Techniques, patterns, testing approaches
- `rag-systems/` - RAG architecture, chunking, retrieval strategies
- `agents/` - Agent patterns, orchestration, tool use
- `llm-fundamentals/` - Model behavior, parameters, capabilities
- `frameworks/` - LangChain, LangGraph, other tools
- `deployment/` - Production considerations, monitoring, optimization

### By Source
- `bootcamp/` - Notes organized by bootcamp modules
- `experiments/` - Learnings from hands-on trials
- `resources/` - Summaries of key articles, papers, talks

## Note-Taking Approach

Each note aims to capture:
- **Core concept** - What is it?
- **Why it matters** - Context and use cases
- **How to apply** - Practical implementation
- **Connections** - Links to other concepts or existing knowledge
- **Open questions** - Things to explore further
