# Projects

Hands-on implementations, experiments, and applications built during the learning journey.

## Organization

Projects are organized by complexity and focus area:

### Experiments
Small-scale trials and proofs of concept:
- Testing specific techniques
- Exploring API capabilities
- Validating approaches

### Mini-Projects
Focused applications with clear scope:
- Implementing specific patterns (RAG, agents, etc.)
- Building reusable components
- Solving particular problems

### Portfolio Projects
More complete applications demonstrating integrated skills:
- End-to-end implementations
- Production-ready (or near-production) quality
- Showcasing unique value proposition (UX + AI)

## Project Template

Each project folder should include:
- `README.md` - Purpose, approach, learnings
- `requirements.txt` or `package.json` - Dependencies
- Source code with clear organization
- Example outputs or demos
- Reflections on what worked/didn't work
