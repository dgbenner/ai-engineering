## Resource Evaluation Criteria

When adding resources, consider:
- **Relevance**: Does it address current learning focus?
- **Quality**: Is it from credible sources/practitioners?
- **Actionability**: Can I apply this directly?
- **Recency**: Is it current with the rapidly evolving field?
- **Uniqueness**: Does it offer perspective not found elsewhere?
